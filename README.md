tiny_linux_shell_script
####Here is some tiny linux shell script used by myself.
####Maybe useful for you.
* **ipv6autostart.sh** : try to get my ipv6 enable on ubuntu.
* **cp-p** : try to give you progress show and time count for "cp" command.
* **haveabreak.sh** : try to info myself to have a break every hour.
* **changkeys.sh** : try to revert the function of Ctrl & CapsLock.
* **jietu.sh** : try to take a screenshot by choosing area.
* **wc-all.sh**: count the words,lines,bytes of files below some dir,it count the subdir recursively.
There are two way to using it.
Just using it like: `wc-all.sh /home` or `wc-all.sh /home 1` 
Set $2 ot 1 is to using loop1 which ignore files start with '.' ,and other $2 input is to using loop2 which include the files start with '.'
